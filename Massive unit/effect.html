											<h2>Lady Macbeth</h2>

										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									-->
										<p>Lady Macbeth has a very noticeable effect on the play throughout her abusive relationship with power.
											 She is first exposed to power through the witches’ words to Macbeth, and soon after her corrupting pursuit
											  of power through Macbeth begins and eventually ends with her death after going insane from the guilt she
												has received from pursuing Macbeth’s power throughout the play. Her guilt from pursuing Macbeth’s power
												is shown through “The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—
												No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting.”, where Lady Macbeth is unsure
												if her bloody hands will ever be clean as the blood is used to represent her guilt caused by pursuing Macbeth’s power.</p>

											<h2>Duncan</h2>

									-->
										<p>During the early stages of Macbeth, Duncan is in full control of all power in Scotland and
											through Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s pursuit of power he is killed to allow Macbeth to obtain
											the divine power of Kings. This is especially pivotal as the killing of Duncan had a drastic effect
											on the play and had the same effect on Macbeth’s pursuit of power as because of Duncan's
											murder, other involuntary actions had to be taken to allow Macbeth to continue with his newly
											found power, most notable the murder of Banquo and Macduff’s family.</p>

											<h2>Banquo</h2>
										</header>
										<!--
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									-->
										<p>Banquo is also very seriously impacted by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s pursuit of power as
											initially, Banquo wanted the same power obtained by Macbeth as the Thane of Cawdor but soon
											realises the effect it has had on Macbeth. Later on in the play, Banquo must pay the ultimate
											price as he is next in line to become King and have the divine and ultimate power they obtain.
											This is because Macbeth is required to betray and kill him, so that Macbeth can take Banquo’s
											position and take the power of Duncan after he is murdered.
