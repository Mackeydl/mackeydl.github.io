								<p>Macbeth is a tragic play published by William Shakespeare in 1606. The play touches on themes such as witchcraft, disorder and anarchy, the supernatural &
									superstition, death, constrating appearence and reality, ambition, evil and power, through a plot set in Scotland during the late renaissance period.
									The plot features its main character as a war-torn and devoted servant to the King of Scotland, a man named Macbeth who is corrupted by a promise from three withes tha he will become King.
									This is promise corrupts Macbeth as he becomes ambitious to the sight of having such a power and as such he is willing to devote himself in anyway
									possible to recieve this power even through the killing of the King and other pivotal characters. Macbeth eventually comes to the realisation that the power has gotten to him and because of
									this he has to fight another servant to the King, Macduff and is killed. Power is a key feature which defines the plot and each scene through its expression of it on notable characters for instance,
									Duncan as he has control over Scotland and Macbeth via his ambitious journey of conquering this power. </p>
