									<h2>Reasons for<br/>
									obtaining Power</a></h2>
									<h3 class="IntroMacbeth">In Macbeth, there are many reasons for obtaining power from the divine ability
									and power that a king can have over his people, to the extreme control over someone's life and their death.
									Power is specifically sought throughout the play through characters such as Macbeth, Lady Macbeth and the witches</h3>

											<h2>Lady Macbeth</h2>

									-->
										<p>Lady Macbeth had an important role in the obtaining of Macbeth’s power, as she would regularly
 										convince Macbeth and/or taunt him if he chose to not receive a greater level of power, this is
										shown in “Prithee, peace: I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.”
										where Macbeth is having second thoughts about murdering the king and “What beast was't,
										then, That made you break this enterprise to me? Then you durst do it, then you were a man;
										And to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place,
										Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.” where Lady Macbeth attacks Macbeth's
										manhood and masculinity in an attempt to convince him to kill the King and receive a greater level of power.</p>

										<p>Macbeth, being the main character in Macbeth was at the centre of power throughout most of
											the play, mainly due to influences from Lady Macbeth and the witches. However Macbeth had
											his own personal ambition towards the obtainment of his power, this is shown through Act 1
											Scene 7 where during a soliloquy Macbeth conveys his thoughts about his own ambition, “I have
											no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls
											on th' other.”, this shows that he is not only influenced by Lady Macbeth but that he is also
	influenced by his own intentions through the pursuit of power.</p>

											<h2>The Witches</h2>

										<!--
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									-->
										<p>During the first few acts of Macbeth, the witches constantly alert Macbeth to the fact that he can have the divine power of kings and that he will obtain it.
											As shown in Act 1 Scene 3, “ All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!”, “All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!”,
										“All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!”,
 										where the witches convince Macbeth that he will obtain this power, this is especially pivotal as at the time, supernatural beings
										as such as the witches were believe to exist and it was common place to see them. The witches made note to convince Macbeth
										that he would climb the ladder of power through first becoming the Thane of Glamis and soon after, the Thane of Cawdor.</p>
